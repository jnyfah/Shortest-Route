# Shortest-Route

his repository includes some example modern CMake configurations which I have picked up
when exploring it's usage for various projects. The examples are laid out in a tutorial like format.
The first examples are very basic and slowly increase in complexity drawing on previous examples to show
more complex use cases.

These examples have been tested on Ubuntu 16.04 but should work under any Linux system that supports CMake v3.5+.

This branch works with the CMake version 3.5 onwards.
